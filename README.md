# Biomedical Image Analysis

## Overview
Early detection of brain tumors is critical for improving patient survival rates.  
Traditional **manual MRI analysis** is time-consuming and prone to human error.  
AI-driven methods can enhance **diagnostic accuracy** and **efficiency** by automating tumor detection.  

### Key Benefits:
- Provides a **non-invasive, automated** tool for detecting brain tumors.  
- Reduces dependency on **manual MRI interpretation**, assisting radiologists.  
- Enhances **diagnostic speed and accuracy**, leading to better treatment decisions.  
- Bridges the gap between **AI, bioinformatics, and medical applications**.  

## Objectives
- Develop a **deep learning-based system** for detecting brain tumors from MRI scans using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.  
- Classify tumors based on learned features.  
- Localize the tumor region within the MRI scan.  

## Expected Outcome
- A **trained CNN model** capable of accurately detecting and classifying brain tumors.  
- **Visual representation** of the tumor location within the MRI scan.  
- An **AI-powered system** that assists radiologists in faster and more reliable diagnosis.  

## Dataset
The **Brain Tumor MRI dataset** is collected from **IEEE Dataport**:  
[Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/brain-tumor-mri-dataset#files)  

This dataset combines the following three sources:  
- **Figshare**  
- **SARTAJ dataset**  
- **Br35H dataset** (used for the "no tumor" class)  

**Dataset Overview:**  
- **7,023 human brain MRI images**  
- Classified into **4 classes**:  
  - **Glioma**  
  - **Meningioma**  
  - **Pituitary tumor**  
  - **No tumor**  

## Methodology  

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Convert MRI scans to **grayscale**  
- Normalize **pixel values**  
- Resize images for **consistency**  

### 2. Model Architecture
- A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is used to analyze MRI images and extract key features for classification and localization.  

### 3. Localization
- The model identifies the **region of interest** in the MRI scan where the tumor is located.  

### 4. Evaluation & Refinement
- Performance is assessed using **accuracy metrics**.  
- **Optimization techniques** are applied to improve results.  

## Time Complexity Analysis  
In **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)**, analyzing efficiency is crucial.  

The CNN model consists of layers with different **computational complexities**:  
- **Convolutional Layer**: O(n²k²) *(where n is input size, k is kernel size)*  
- **Fully Connected Layer**: O(nm) *(where n and m are neurons in consecutive layers)*  

This complexity analysis helps in optimizing the model for **faster execution**.  

## Optimization Techniques
- **Gradient Descent & Backpropagation** are used to train the CNN efficiently.  
- **Dropout & Batch Normalization** are applied to enhance **generalization** and prevent overfitting.  
- These techniques optimize CNNs similar to how **traditional algorithms** are optimized in **DAA**.  

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with **real-time MRI processing** for faster diagnosis.  
- Explainable AI (XAI) for **interpretable** medical decisions.  
- Deployment as a **web-based or mobile AI tool** for radiologists.
